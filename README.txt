A remixed version of Tide by ElectricAlice, 
with the following changes:

- Pastel-ish colors that are easier on the eyes;
- No gradients or shadows in the elements;
- Relationship tags are emphasized 
with bold and italics 
(Blurblings Shipper skin code);
- Commas removed after tags 
(Incommodious skin code);
- There are stars between the tags 
(pulled from ElectricAlice's Minimal Skin)

As I mainly use my phone to browse AO3, 
code from the "mobile fix" code 
has been included as well. 
If you use it on multiple devices, 
you may want to paste said code 
to another skin, set it to 
"only screen (42em)", 
and set this skin as a parent skin.

Colors and the font have been selected 
with the Wizard and reappear in some 
instances in the code. Here they are:

- Font:Times New Roman;
- Background color:#fffaf4;
- Text color:#825550;
- Header color:#b1cdd9;
- Accent color:#ffeeea;

For some interactions with the buttons 
and the stars in the tags, 
the color code is as follows: #fece9c
